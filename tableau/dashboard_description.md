This dashboard evaluates NHL trades using skater xGAR to measure on-ice value.
Realized value reflects post-trade performance, while expected value captures remaining upside from draft picks and prospects.
Future assets are time-discounted and prospects are adjusted for attrition to reflect development risk.
Goalie-only trades are excluded.
